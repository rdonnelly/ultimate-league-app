"""URL-resolution smoke tests.

The single highest-value guard for the Django upgrade: every named URL in the
project must reverse to a path. This catches the routing-layer breakage that the
upgrade churns through -- the move of ``reverse`` from ``django.core.urlresolvers``
to ``django.urls`` (Django 2.0), and the removal of ``django.conf.urls.url`` in
favor of ``re_path``/``path`` (Django 4.0). If a URLconf fails to import or a name
is dropped during conversion, these assertions fail immediately.

The named patterns are enumerated explicitly (rather than walked from the
resolver) so that a name silently disappearing is itself a test failure.
